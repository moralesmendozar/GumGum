This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Assuming filtered is already loaded in
library(dplyr)
library(mosaic)
resp <- filtered %>%
  mutate(winner = !is.na(winner))
good <- resp %>%
  filter(winner == TRUE)   # We look at differences between bid requests that were and weren't responded to
bad <- resp %>%
  filter(winner == FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Examining bidfloor
foo <- resp %>%
  filter(bidfloor < 30)
bwplot(winner~bidfloor, data=foo)
t.test(good$bidfloor~bad$bidfloor)
```

```{r}
foo <- resp %>%
  filter(tmax < 400)
bwplot(winner~tmax, data=foo)
bar <- resp %>%
  filter(tmax > 400) %>%
  filter(tmax < 4000)
bwplot(winner~tmax, data=bar)
tally(resp$winner~resp$tmax)
```

```{r}
foo <- resp %>%
  group_by(dayofweek) %>%
  summarize(win = sum(winner),
            lose = n() - sum(winner))
bar <- foo %>%
  mutate(win = round(win / sum(win),3),
         lose = round(lose / sum(lose),3))
chisq.test(foo)
```
